### :raising_hand: **BiciMAD Planner** 
This app's goal is to  help you navigate through Madrid's MADness with one of the best transport options available for tourism, BiciMAD bicicles.

### :baby: **Status**
Alpha

### :running: **One-liner**
This app will help you locate nearest **nearest BiciMAD station** from any **monument** and create a visiting plan for the **choosen monuments** in the form of an **interactive map**.

Give it a try on ![Link](https://tour-planner.fly.dev/)

### :computer: **Technology stack**
This app is hosted in a fly.io server as a docker container. The interface for uthe user is composed of a webapp made up with Flask library which executes a python script(main). Main libraries used are requests, pandas, numpy and folium

### :wrench: **Configuration**
For testing and personal usage you can use the link given above. To run the script in your own system just clone, create a virtual enviroment, install python and then just `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the project folder.

## **Formatting**
Your readers will most likely view your README in a browser so please keep that in mind when formatting its content: 
- Use proper format when necesary (e.g.: `import pandas as pd`). 
- Categorize content using two or three levels of header beneath. 
- Make use of **emphasis** to call out important words. 
- Link to project pages for related libraries you mention. Link to Wikipedia, Wiktionary, even Urban Dictionary definitions for words of which a reader may not be familiar. Make amusing cultural references. 
- Add links to related projects or services.

## **Start writing ASAP:**
*Last but not least, by writing your README soon you give yourself some pretty significant advantages. Most importantly, you’re giving yourself a chance to think through the project without the overhead of having to change code every time you change your mind about how something should be organized or what should be included.*


## **Suggested Structure:**

### :raising_hand: **Name** 
Self-explanatory names are best. If the name sounds too vague or unrelated, it may be a signal to move on. It also must be catchy. Images, Logo, Gif or some color is strongly recommended.

### :baby: **Status**
Alpha, Beta, 1.1, Ironhack Data Analytics Final Project, etc... It's OK to write a sentence, too. The goal is to let interested people know where this project is at.

### :running: **One-liner**
Having a one-liner that describes the pipeline/api/app is useful for getting an idea of what your code does in slightly greater detail. 

### :computer: **Technology stack**
Python, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc. Indicate the technological nature of the software, including primary programming language(s), main libraries and whether the software is intended as standalone or as a module in a framework or other ecosystem.

### :boom: **Core technical concepts and inspiration**
Why does it exist? Frame your project for the potential user. Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects. Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.

### :wrench: **Configuration**
Requeriments, prerequisites, dependencies, installation instructions.

### :see_no_evil: **Usage**
Parameters, return values, known issues, thrown errors.

### :file_folder: **Folder structure**
```

    ├── __trash__
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .env
    ├── README.md

> Do not forget to include `__trash__` and `.env` in `.gitignore` 

### :shit: **ToDo**
Next steps, features planned, known bugs (shortlist).

### :information_source: **Further info**
Credits, alternatives, references, license.

### :love_letter: **Contact info**
Getting help, getting involved, hire me please.
